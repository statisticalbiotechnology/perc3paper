\section{Introduction}

The Percolator algorithm, first described in 2007 \cite{kall:semi-supervised}, has become one of the most widely used software tools in the field of mass spectrometry proteomics.
The Percolator software takes as input database search results produced by any one of a variety of search tools and then applies a semi-supervised machine learning approach to rank the identified spectra based on the quality of the peptide-spectrum matches.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Speeding up Percolator}

We implemented two speedups in Percolator.
First, we incorporated a Windows-compatible version of conjugate
gradient least squares support vector machine training \cite{halloran:speeding}.
Second, we implemented a layer-ordered heaps sorting and selection
strategy for partitioning training sets \cite{lucke:performing}.

On an Intel-i5 9600K-3.7 GHz-6core cpu, we measure a performance increase of 89\% with the new code as compared to version 3.03 when processing a very large set of $2.5\cdot10^8$ peptide-spectrum matches (4.0 vs 2.1 CPU hours needed).
The performance increase is consistent accross sizes of data sets, see Figure \ref{fig:performance}.

      (C) the peak resident memory size, i.e. the amount of RAM needed as a function of the number of PSMs. 
      For the plot we subsampled a set of 25 million PSMs, and executed the different verions of percolator 6 times and reported the execution with the lowest resource usage, to minimize the potential influence of other processes on performance.}

\subsection{Integration with FragPipe}

Benchmark between fragpipe with Peptide Prophet and with Percolator?

We have implemented a protocol for using Percolator to match MS1 precursors accross different mass spectrometry runs based on their difference in mass and retention time \cite{the:focus}, which allows the software to be used for label-free quantification.

We have also implemented an interface to the OpenSWATH module EasyPQ, thereby facilitating using Percolator as a part of data-independent acquisition
workflows.

\section*{Methods}

We benchmarked the performance of Percolator ver 2.8, 3.0, 3.3, and 3.6 on an Intel-i5 9600K-3.7 GHz-6core cpu, downloaded from \url{https://github.com/percolator/percolator/releases}. The dataset used was 25 million PSMs, with spectra from Kim {\em et al.}\cite{kim2014draft} matched to uniprot with Crux\cite{park2008rapid}.
The runtime and memory use performance was measured with Linux's {\tt /usr/bin/time} command. 

\section*{Discussion}

Behind the scenes, we have also improved Percolator from a software engineering perspective.
First, we have implemented continuous integration of the Percolator source code via Github Actions.
This implementation automatically generates installation packages for Windows, MacOS, Ubuntu and CentOS.
Second, we have created extensive automated unit testing.
To do so, we have integrated the Google Test framework into the CMake build, as an optional feature.
The automated build system runs the unit test suite automatically with each check-in and includes support for the code coverage tool gcov.
