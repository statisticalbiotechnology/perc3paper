\opening{Dear Joseph A. Loo:}

Enclosed you will find a revised version of the manuscript
ASMS-D-16-00083, ``Fast and accurate protein false discovery rates on
large-scale proteomics data sets with Percolator 3.0''. Also, find
attached detailed response to the reviewers and a diff to the first
revision of the manuscript. As seen by the diff we have extensively
modified the manuscript based on the input from the
reviewers. Particularly, based on the reviews we introduced a
benchmark against the protein inference method, Fido.

Sincerely,\\[2em]
Mr. Matthew The,\\
Prof. Michael MacCoss,\\
Prof. William S Noble \& \\
